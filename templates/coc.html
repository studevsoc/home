              Events, as part of the greater Student Developer Society, assume
              good faith on all those who wish to improve student developers.
              However, other experiences at other conferences have shown us the
              need to adopt a Code of Conduct in which we state our expectations
              of all attendees and organizers during the SDS events and in our
              telegram platform.<br />This code of conduct applies to all
              members at SDS, in addition to the SDS code of conduct that
              applies to the Student Developers Society as a whole.

              The Student Developers Society welcomes and encourages
              participation by everyone.<br />No matter how you identify
              yourself or how others perceive you: we welcome you. We welcome
              contributions from everyone as long as they interact
              constructively with our community.<br />While much of the work for
              our project is technical in nature, we value and encourage
              contributions from those with expertise in other areas, and
              welcome them into our community.

              SDS Events is committed to providing a safe environment for all
              participants. All attendees are expected to treat all people and
              facilities with respect and help create a welcoming environment.
              If you notice behaviour that fails to meet this standard, please
              speak up and help to keep SDS events as respectful as we expect it
              to be.<br />SDS is committed to the ideas expressed in our
              Diversity Statement (above) and the recently adopted Debian Code
              of Conduct. We ask all our members, speakers, volunteers,
              attendees and guests to adopt these principles. We are a diverse
              community. Sometimes this means we need to work harder to ensure
              we&#39;re creating an environment of trust and respect where all
              who come to participate feel comfortable and included.<br />We
              value your participation and appreciate your help in realizing
              this goal.

              Respect yourself, and respect others. Be courteous to those around
              you. If someone indicates they don&#39;t wish to be photographed,
